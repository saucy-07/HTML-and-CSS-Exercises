                <p>Toucans are well known for their big, brightly coloured beaks and exceptional beauty. These birds are native to the Neotropics from Southern Mexico through to Northern Argentina.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Toucans are social birds as they normally live in groups of around 20 or more birds at a time. They spend time brawling it out with their beaks and playing 'tag'. These birds nest within tree hollows and will generally produce around 2 to 4 white eggs. The toucan's main source of food are fruits but do eat insects, smaller birds and lizards. </p>
